        <p>This website is dedicated to the Novastratum's LayerX project.</p>

        <h2>What is Novastratum?</h2>
        <a><img src="unnamed.jpg" style="width:200px;height: 200px" alt="Novastratum LayerX"></a>
        <p>Novastratum is a revolutionary technology company focused on creating innovative solutions for the climate change basically about the car filtres.</p>

        <h2>What is layerX?</h2>
        <p>The usual filres for the automobiles usually works with in the range of 250 cantigrat degrees and 1000 cantigrat degrees. The most important proplem of the filtres are that they are inefficient when it is cooler than 250 degrees celsius.</p>
        <p> This filtre focuses on this problem. Its main idea is to prevent the CO(Carbon monoxide) to release to the atmosphere.</p></p>
    </main>
    <main>
        <h2>What is LayerX</h2>
        <p>Modern internal combustion engines produce *CO (carbon monoxide)* and *NOx (nitrogen oxides)* gases in the highest concentrations when they first start (cold start). Since current catalytic converters are not sufficiently active at low temperatures (0–250 °C), these harmful gases are released directly into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>In this project, a *new generation, precious metal-free* exhaust filter was developed using *Co–Mn–Mg–Al mixed metal oxides* derived from *Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH)* structure. This filter is specifically designed to operate in the *0–250 °C temperature range*.</p>
    </main>
    <main>
        <h2>What materials are used?</h2>
        <p>The materials used in the LayerX project include Co–Mn–Mg–Al mixed metal oxides derived from Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH) structure.</p>
        <p>Co–Mn–Mg–Al LDH-derived mixed metal oxides* are obtained by converting layered hydroxide structures into oxide phases through controlled heat treatment. Structural advantages include:</p>
        <p>🔹 High surface area</p>
        <p>🔹 Homogeneous metal distribution</p>
        <p>🔹 Adjustable pore structure</p>
        <p>🔹 Strong redox centers (Mn³⁺/Mn⁴⁺, Co²⁺/Co³⁺)</p>
    </main>
    <main>
        <h2>Scientific abutements</h2>
        <p>This material group is used in academic studies for:</p>
        <p>🔹 Low-temperature NOx adsorption</p>
        <p>🔹 Mn and Co-based redox activity</p>
        <p>🔹 Pt-free PNA systems</p>
